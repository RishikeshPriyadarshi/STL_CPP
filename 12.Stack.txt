EX: When we attend the marriage, then we hv many plates    
  we pick the top plate, we don't pick the latter
  or below one..
  we always pick up the top plate, the standing behind
  us will ddo the same..

  What Does it mean?

  >Whenever the plates r kept , they kept on top of each other,
  which means,
  The plate kept First is at Bottom
  and it will be used at Last...


  NOTE:
  -----
  In STACK conceptt of "LIFO is Used"
  which means "the one that goes last will be
               used first"...
