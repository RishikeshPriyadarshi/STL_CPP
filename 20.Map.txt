>"It isa data strucutre in which value is stored
 in the form of key"... 

 Ex;
 suppose our "key is king"
 and "value scorpio"

  so king is pointing to-> scorpio 


NOTE: "Every KEY is UNIQUE"...
    Means one key will point to only one value 

    means king will point to scorpio only
    it(king) cannot point to other vehicle



Means:
>"All KEYS r Unique"

>"one key will point to only 1 value"


NOTE: it can be like this:
   
   Rishi is pointing to scorpio
    and
   King is pointing to scorpio

   "means value can be same"

   "but same key will not point to 2 value"
