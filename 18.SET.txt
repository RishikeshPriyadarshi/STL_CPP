           SET
           ----

>"All the UNIQUE-Elements r sored in set "

   mean if we hjave put 5 times 5 , then
   5 will only appear only once in Set..

 >"It stores every element only once"

   Means every le should be Unique

   -----------------------------------------------

 Behind the Scenes,
 How it is Implemented?
 >By using BST(Binary-Search-Tree)

 NOTE:
 "Means if we hv already included the element,
 we cannot modify it afterwards,
 'either we place it or delete it' ,
 only these 2 things r avilable"...

 >"There is NO-MODIFICATION"   

 >"the elements r returned in Sorted order"

 >"whn we start taking ele it will come in 
   sorted order"..



     UNORDEERED-SET:
    ------------
  >The diff. in unordered set is that ,

  "SET is Slower than UNORDERED-SET "
