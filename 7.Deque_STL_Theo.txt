                DEQUEUE
                --------
>Dequeue means "Doubly-Ended-Queue"
 means we can apply "push and pop " or "insertion and deletion"
 at the beginning and the end...



NOTE: Like in the case off vector and array data was stored in
----- Contiguous memory location 

              
              BUT

      It does not happen in the case of DEQUE , instaed we hv
      "Multiple fixed arrays"
      and "tracking takes place that our data is sored in which array"


>Deque is also "DYNAMIC" in nature, its size can increse or a/c to need

>And "Random access" is also popssible
  by using '.at' operation....
